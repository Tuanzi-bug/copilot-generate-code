# Code Review Workflow

Execute professional code review following industry best practices with multi-dimensional analysis: security vulnerabilities, code quality, architecture soundness, and responsible AI principles.

## Mission

Perform systematic, comprehensive code review that prevents production issues through layered analysis: OWASP security checks, SOLID principles validation, Well-Architected framework assessment, and bias/accessibility verification. Load only relevant context and update core decision logs without documentation pollution.

## Scope & Preconditions

### Prerequisites
- **Code to review**: ${input:target:Files, PR number, or commit hash to review}
- **Review focus** (optional): ${input:focus:security|quality|architecture|ai-ethics|all}
- **Context accessible**: `context/` and `requirements/` directories
- **Tests passing**: Ideally complete `/tdd` workflow first

### What This Workflow Covers
1. ✅ Security vulnerability detection (OWASP Top 10, LLM security)
2. ✅ Code quality assessment (SOLID, design patterns, complexity)
3. ✅ Architecture validation (Well-Architected frameworks)
4. ✅ Responsible AI review (bias, accessibility, privacy)
5. ✅ Performance and scalability analysis
6. ✅ Documentation and maintainability check

### What This Does NOT Cover
- ❌ Functional testing (use `/tdd` or `/e2e`)
- ❌ Build configuration fixes (use `/build-fix`)
- ❌ Business logic design (use `/plan`)

## Context Loading Strategy

Follow **Effective Context Engineering** principles (Just-in-Time Context):

```
1. Load lightweight index: context/README.md (~500 tokens)
2. Load relevant domain knowledge (按需):
   - context/tech/security-standards.md (安全审查时)
   - context/tech/architecture.md (架构审查时)
   - context/experience/code-review-checklist.md (审查模式)
   - context/experience/lessons-learned.md (已知问题库)
3. Load current requirements (按需):
   - requirements/INDEX.md (需求索引)
   - requirements/in-progress/当前需求.md (if related)
4. Load detailed context only when needed:
   - context/tech/tech-stack.md (技术栈依赖)
   - context/design/patterns.md (设计模式参考)
   - context/business/compliance.md (合规要求)
```

**Key Principle**: Start with index, load details incrementally based on findings.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Review Initialization & Planning

**Objective**: Understand review scope and create targeted review plan

**Steps**:

1. **Load Context Index**
   ```
   Read: context/README.md (project overview)
   Read: requirements/INDEX.md (if exists)
   ```

2. **Analyze Review Target**
   
   Identify what you're reviewing:
   
   **By Code Type**:
   - 🌐 **Web API/Backend** → Security (OWASP), performance, scalability
   - 🤖 **AI/ML Integration** → OWASP LLM Top 10, bias, explainability
   - 🎨 **Frontend/UI** → Accessibility, responsive design, UX
   - 📊 **Data Processing** → Privacy, efficiency, error handling
   - 🔐 **Authentication** → Crypto, access control, session management
   - ⚙️ **Infrastructure** → Configuration security, secrets management
   
   **By Risk Level**:
   - 🔴 **High Risk**: Payment, authentication, AI decisions, admin functions, PII
   - 🟡 **Medium Risk**: User data, external APIs, reporting
   - 🟢 **Low Risk**: UI components, utilities, display logic

3. **Create Targeted Review Plan**
   
   Based on ${input:focus} and code analysis, select 3-5 most relevant areas:
   
   ```markdown
   ## Review Plan for ${input:target}
   
   **Code Type**: [API/AI/Frontend/Data/Auth/Infra]
   **Risk Level**: [High/Medium/Low]
   **Primary Concerns**: [Security/Quality/Architecture/AI-Ethics]
   
   **Selected Review Areas** (3-5 max):
   - [ ] Security: [OWASP categories relevant to this code]
   - [ ] Quality: [Specific quality concerns]
   - [ ] Architecture: [Architecture aspects to validate]
   - [ ] Responsible AI: [If AI/ML code]
   - [ ] Performance: [If performance-critical]
   ```

4. **Load Domain-Specific Context**
   ```
   Based on review plan, load ONLY relevant files:
   - Security review → context/tech/security-standards.md
   - Architecture review → context/tech/architecture.md
   - AI review → context/experience/ai-safety-checklist.md
   ```

### Phase 1: Security Review

   ```
   
   Continue through all OWASP categories relevant to code type.

3. **OWASP LLM Top 10 Checks** (AI/ML Systems)
   
   **LLM01 - Prompt Injection**:
   ```
   ❌ Check for:
   - User input directly interpolated into prompts
   - No prompt delimiters or separators
   - System instructions exposed to users
   
   ✅ Verify:
   - User input sanitized before prompt construction
   - Clear delimiters between system/user content
   - Prompt hardening techniques applied
   ```
   
   **LLM02 - Insecure Output Handling**:
   ```
   ❌ Check for:
   - LLM output used directly in SQL/commands
   - No validation of model responses
   - Trusting model output as safe
   
   ✅ Verify:
   - Output validation before use
   - Sanitization for downstream systems
   - Rate limiting and monitoring
   ```
   
   Apply remaining LLM security checks as relevant.

4. **Document Security Findings**
   ```
   Create: review-results/security-findings.md
   
   Structure:
   - 🔴 Critical: [Immediate action required]
   - 🟡 High: [Fix before merge]
   - 🟢 Medium: [Fix in follow-up]
   - ℹ️ Low: [Technical debt/best practice]
   
   For each finding:
   - Location (file:line)
   - Vulnerability type
   - Risk assessment
   - Recommended fix (with code example)
   - References (CWE, OWASP)
   ```

**Steps**:

1. **Load AI Ethics Context**
   ```
   Read: context/experience/ai-safety-checklist.md (if exists)
   Read: context/business/compliance.md (if GDPR/privacy relevant)
   ```

2. **Bias & Fairness Check**
   
   **Test with Diverse Inputs**:
   ```python
   # Names from different cultures
   test_names = [
       "John Smith", "José García", "Lakshmi Patel", 
       "Ahmed Hassan", "李明", "O'Brien", "X Æ A-12"
   ]
   
   # Age diversity
   test_ages = [18, 25, 45, 65, 75]
   
   # Edge cases
   test_edge = ["", "  ", "NULL", "<script>", "'; DROP TABLE--"]
   ```

   - System fails with non-English characters
   - No explanation for AI decisions
   - Training data bias not addressed

3. **Accessibility Quick Check** (User-Facing Code)
   
   **Keyboard Navigation**:
   ```html
   ✅ Good:
   <button onClick={submit}>Submit</button>
   
   ❌ Bad:
   <div onClick={submit}>Submit</div>  <!-- Can't tab to it -->
   ```
   
   **Screen Reader Support**:
   ```html
   ✅ Good:
   <input aria-label="Search products" placeholder="Search..."/>
   <img src="chart.jpg" alt="Sales increased 25% in Q3"/>
   
   ❌ Bad:
   <input placeholder="Search..."/>  <!-- No context when empty -->
   <img src="chart.jpg"/>  <!-- No description -->
   ```
   
   **Visual Accessibility**:
   - Text contrast ratio ≥4.5:1 (normal text), ≥3:1 (large text)
   - Color not sole indicator (use icons + color)
   - Zoom to 200% without breaking layout
   - Focus indicators visible

4. **Privacy & Data Protection**
   ```
   ✅ Check for:
   - Minimal data collection (collect only what's needed)
   - Anonymization where possible
   - Clear data retention policies
   - User consent for data processing
   - Right to deletion implementation
   - Transparent data usage
   ```

5. **Explainability & Transparency**
   ```
   For AI decisions:
   - Can the system explain why it made a decision?
   - Are confidence scores exposed?
   - Is there a human appeal process?
   - Are limitations documented?
   ```

6. **Document Responsible AI Findings**
   ```
   Update: review-results/responsible-ai-findings.md
   
   Sections:
   - Bias & Fairness Issues
   - Accessibility Violations
   - Privacy Concerns
   - Explainability Gaps
   ```

### Phase 5: Performance & Best Practices

   - [ ] Request re-review after fixes
   ```

4. **Update Core Documentation** (Prevent Pollution!)
   
   **ONLY update if significant patterns discovered**:
   
   ```
   Update: context/experience/code-review-checklist.md
   
   Add ONLY:
   - New vulnerability patterns specific to this project
   - Recurring issues worth tracking
   - Project-specific review focus areas
   
   DO NOT add:
   - Detailed review logs
   - Individual finding descriptions
   - Temporary observations
   ```
   
   ```
   Update: context/experience/lessons-learned.md
   
   Add ONLY:
   - New anti-patterns discovered
   - Effective fixes for recurring problems
   - Architecture decisions that prevented issues
   
   DO NOT add:
   - Complete review transcripts
   - One-time issues
   - Generic best practices
   ```

5. **Output Review Results**
   
   Present summary to user and offer next steps:
   ```
   - Export detailed findings to file
   - Create GitHub issue for each critical finding
   - Generate automated fix suggestions
   - Schedule follow-up review
   ```

## Quality Assurance

### Review Checklist

Before completing review, verify:

- [ ] All selected review areas covered
- [ ] Critical issues have actionable fixes with code examples
- [ ] Findings prioritized by severity and impact
- [ ] Positive patterns highlighted (not just problems)
- [ ] Documentation updated only with core patterns (no pollution)
- [ ] Context files loaded were relevant (no over-loading)
- [ ] Review summary is concise and actionable

### Review Quality Metrics

Track review effectiveness:
```
- Issues found vs. issues in production (catch rate)
- False positives (issues that weren't real problems)
- Time to complete review
- Context tokens used
- Documentation updates made
```

## Integration with Other Workflows

### Before Code Review
- Complete `/tdd` workflow (unit tests passing)
- Run `/build-fix` if build errors exist
- Complete `/e2e` for integration validation

### After Code Review
- Run `/build-fix` to verify fixes don't break build
- Re-run `/tdd` to ensure tests still pass
- Use `/remember` to capture lessons learned
- Use `/memory-merger` to update project knowledge

## Best Practices

### Effective Context Loading
- **Start lightweight**: Load only index files initially
- **Load incrementally**: Add detailed context based on findings
- **Avoid pre-loading**: Don't load all possible context upfront
- **Use grep/search**: Find specific information instead of reading full files

### Prevent Documentation Pollution
- **Core only**: Update only architectural decisions, patterns, recurring issues
- **No logs**: Don't document detailed review transcripts
- **Reference**: Link to review files instead of copying content
- **Temporary**: Use `review-results/` for session-specific findings

### Token Optimization
- **Targeted agents**: Use specialized subagents for deep analysis
- **Parallel review**: If multiple files, review independently when possible
- **Pattern matching**: Check against known issue patterns first
- **Summary first**: Generate executive summary before details

### Continuous Improvement
- **Track patterns**: Identify recurring issues across reviews
- **Update checklists**: Add project-specific checks as patterns emerge
- **Share learnings**: Use `/remember` to capture valuable insights
- **Feedback loop**: Validate review effectiveness against production issues
